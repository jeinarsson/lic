The following Sections describe the research that I have performed with my collegues and collaborators over the last two and a half years. The material is organised according to different ``projects'', or questions. The first three Sections roughly correspond to the Papers A--C. The last Section is a brief discourse on orientational correlation functions in random flows with finite correlation time. The material is not published, but I nevertheless think it is interesting enough to deserve some attention here.
