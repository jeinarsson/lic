\chapter{Tumbling in turbulent flows}

Together with Kristian Gustavsson we investigate the orientational dynamics of small particles in random and turbulent flows. Kristian has extensive experience in studying the translational dynamics of spherical particles in random flows. In the previous Sections, describing Papers A \& B, we considered only steady and uniform fluid flows. In this project we combine our knowledge of random and turbulent flows with that of the dynamics of non-spherical particles. The collaboration has thus far resulted in Paper C (under review for publication in Physical Review Letters).

\section{Overview}

The dynamics of turbulent flow is fundamentally complicated. It is non-linear and chaotic, and reliable numerical solutions are computationally very expensive. One of the motivations for studying random flows is that, with properly chosen statistics, they may be a model system for understanding the dynamics of particles in turbulence. 
This idea works well for quantities which are not crucially dependent on the specifics of turbulence. For example, one of Kristian's results concerns the relative collision velocities of particles \cite{gustavsson2013relvel}. Through a random flow model he worked out properties universal to colliding particles in any flow. In other cases, however, it turns out that the particle dynamics depends on details in the turbulent flow which are not present in the random flow.

When Parsa et. al. published numerical (DNS) and experimental results on the rotation rates of non-spherical particles in turbulence \cite{parsa2012}, they highlighted a case where the random flow predicts a qualitatively different result from the observation in turbulence. They showed that disk-shaped particles rotate, on average, about twice as fast as rod-shaped particles in turbulence. The naive prediction from a random-flow model is that disks and rods rotate alike. The questions we try to answer in Paper C are, which mechanisms are responsible for the differences in particle rotation rates? How do the statistics of the flow relate to the statistics of the particles? And what is the difference between random flows and turbulence?

It is a well-known fact that the distribution of velocity gradients in turbulent flow is strongly skewed\cite{pumirskewed}. We argue in Paper C that there is a relation between the skewed distribution of velocity gradients and the differing tumbling rates of disks and rods. The broken symmetry means that some flow configurations are more likely than others. We use Jeffery's equation of motion for axisymmetric particles to argue how this asymmetry propagates to the particle rotation. 

As I explained in \Secref{jefferyequation} about \emph{steady flows}, the orientational dynamics of a particle switches from rotation to alignment when one replaces a rod with a disk, or vice versa. Therefore, if rods and disks are to tumble alike on average, we must require that particles experience equal amounts of ``rotating'' gradients and ``aligning'' gradients - otherwise the result will be different if we switch the particle.
In other words, the distribution of flow gradients $\ma A$ must be symmetric over $\tr \ma A^3=0$ (see\footnote{Recall, $\ma B=\ma O + \Lambda\ma S$, but $\ma B \to \ma A$ ($-\ma A\transpose$) as the particle shape $\Lambda\to 1$ ($-1$).} \Figref{bmap} in \Secref{jefferyequation}.) This symmetry does not exist in turbulence.

However, this argument does not close the case, because it is only true for \emph{steady} flow ($\ku\to\infty$), and turbulence is absolutely not steady. The more technical part of the paper is a calculation valid at the other extreme: $\ku \ll 1$, or very unsteady flows, more so than turbulence. As shown in the paper, the calculation reinforces the picture outlined above.

It turns out that the first contribution to the rotation rate which is different for rods and disks comes from the third-order correlation functions of the flow velocity gradients. Specifically, the correlation function $\langle \ma O(0) \ma O(0) \ma S(-t)\rangle$ makes a strong contribution. Here, as throughout this thesis, $\ma O$ and $\ma S$ are the antisymmetric and symmetric parts of the Lagrangian\footnote{Along a particle trajectory; as experienced by the particle.} flow gradient matrix. The interpretation is that flow regions where there is first stretching flow ($\ma S$) and then high vorticity ($\ma O^2$) makes disks rotate, but rods align.

The manuscript is necessarily brief on some technical details, and in the following I will elaborate on two of them. First, I will show how to arrive at Eq.~(4) starting from Eq.~(3) in the manuscript. Second, I will give some detail on how we collected and verified Lagrangian statistics in a turbulent flow. 

\section{Derivation of the result Eq.~(4)}

In order to derive the final result, we need to establish some facts about Lagrangian correlation functions in isotropic and incompressible flow. We denote the matrix of flow gradients by 
\begin{align*}
\ma A(\ve r(t), t) &= \nabla \ve u(\ve r(t), t),
\intertext{or in component notation}	
A_{ij}(\ve r(t), t) &= \frac{\partial}{\partial r_j}u_i(\ve r(t), t).
\end{align*}
The correlation functions between elements of a matrix $\ma A$ are denoted
\begin{align*}
	C^{AA}_{ijkl}(t) &\equiv \left\langle A_{ij}(\ve r(0),0)A_{kl}(\ve r(t), t)\right\rangle,\\
	C^{AAA}_{ijklmn}(t_1,t_2) &\equiv \left\langle A_{ij}(0)A_{kl}(t_1)A_{mn}(t_2)\right\rangle,
\end{align*}
and so on.
We separate the gradient into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts,
\begin{align*}
	&\ma O = \frac{1}{2}(\ma A - \ma A\transpose),\quad
	\ma S = \frac{1}{2}(\ma A + \ma A\transpose),\quad
	\ma A = \ma O + \ma S.
\end{align*}
It turns out that the all the second and third order correlation functions between $\ma S$ and $\ma O$ factorise in a very convenient manner. All of them become products of one time-dependent function, and one part which depends only on the spatial indices, but not time. For example, in three spatial dimensions
\begin{align}
	C^{OO}_{ijkl}(t) &= \frac{\left\langle \tr \ma O_0\ma O_t\right\rangle}{6}( \delta_{il}\delta_{jk}-\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl}), \nn\\
	C^{SS}_{ijkl}(t) &= \frac{\left\langle \tr \ma S_0\ma S_t\right\rangle}{30}(3\delta_{il}\delta_{jk} + 3\delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} - 2\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl}), \nn\\
	C^{SO}_{ijkl}(t) &= 0. \eqnlab{turbjpoint}
\end{align}
Here the functions $\left\langle \tr \ma O_0\ma O_t\right\rangle$ and $\left\langle \tr \ma S_0\ma S_t\right\rangle$ are functions of time which are flow-specific. They can be determined through a flow model, measurement, or, as in our case, numerical DNS data. See the next Section for details.

Similar, but lengthier, results exist for the eight three-point correlations $C^{SSS}_{ijklmn}(t)$, $C^{SSO}_{ijklmn}(t)$, ..., $C^{OOO}_{ijklmn}(t)$. The detailed derivation and final expressions are given in Appendix~\secref{applagrangian}.

Now we are equipped for the derivation. The dimensionless equation of motion for the particle position $\ve r$ and orientation $\ve n$ reads
\begin{align*}
\dot{\ve r}&=\ku\,\ve u\,,\quad
\dot{\ve n}=\ku\left[\ma O\ve n+\Lambda\left(\ma S\ve n-(\ve n\transpose\ma S\ve n)\ve n\right)\right]\,.
\end{align*}
Here, $\Lambda$ is the particle shape function, $\Lambda=-1$ for disks, and $\Lambda=1$ for rods. The equation for $\ve r$ comes only implicitly into the equation for $\ve n$, through the dependence of $\ma O$ and $\ma S$ upon particle position.
The squared rotation rate $\langle \dot n^2\rangle$ is
\begin{align}
	\langle \dot n^2\rangle &= \ku^2\left\langle\left(\ma O\ve n+\Lambda\left(\ma S\ve n-(\ve n\transpose\ma S\ve n)\ve n\right)\right)^2\right\rangle\nn \\
	&= \ku^2\left\langle-\ve n\transpose \ma O \ma O \ve n + \Lambda^2\left(\ve n\transpose\ma S\ma S\ve n - (\ve n\transpose\ma S\ve n)^2\right)\right\rangle.\eqnlab{ndotsquared}
\end{align}
We cannot perform the average at this point, because in general the orientation $\ve n$ and the gradient matrices $\ma O$ and $\ma S$ have complicated joint statistics, which we do not know. 
The first approximation is to just insert an initial condition $\ve n(t) \approx \ve n(0) \equiv \ve n_0$.

% Since the flow is isotropic, so is $\ve n_0$. 
%The second and fourth moments of an isotropic unit vector $\ve n$ are found by making an ansatz for a general isotropic tensor (see App.~\secref{applagrangian}) and requiring $n_i n_i=1$, the result is:
\begin{align*}
	\langle n_i n_j \rangle &= \frac{1}{3}\delta_{ij}, \\
	\langle n_i n_j n_k n_l \rangle &= \frac{1}{15}(\delta_{ij}\delta_{kl} + \delta_{ik}\delta_{jl} + \delta_{il}\delta_{jk}).
\end{align*}
This approximation leads to the white-noise result
\begin{align*}
	\langle \dot n^2\rangle &= 
	\ku^2 \left(-\frac{1}{3}\langle\tr\ma O\ma O\rangle +  \frac{\Lambda^2}{3}\langle\tr\ma S \ma S\rangle - \frac{2\Lambda^2}{15}\langle\tr\ma S\ma S \rangle\right) + \mathcal O(\ku^3),  \\
	&= \frac{\ku^2}{3}\left(-\langle\tr\ma O\ma O\rangle +  \frac{3\Lambda^2}{5}\langle\tr\ma S \ma S\rangle\right) + \mathcal O(\ku^3),  \\
	\intertext{and using $\langle\tr\ma A\transpose \ma A\rangle/2=\langle\tr\ma S\ma S\rangle=-\langle\tr\ma O\ma O\rangle$ (see end of App.~\secref{applagrangian})}
	&= \ku^2\frac{\langle\tr\ma A\transpose \ma A\rangle}{30}\left(5 + 3 \Lambda^2\right)+ \mathcal O(\ku^3).  
\end{align*}
But to proceed and reach $\mathcal O(\ku^3)$, we need an expression for $\ve n(t)$.
The equation for $\ve n$ has the implicit solution
\begin{align*}
\ve n_{t'}&=\ve n_0\!+\!\ku\!\int_0^{t'}\!\!\!\!{\rm d}t\,[\ma O_{t}\ve n_{t}\!%
+\!\Lambda(\ma S_{t}\ve n_{t}\!-\!(\ve n_{t}\transpose\ma S_{t}\ve n_{t})\ve n_{t})]\,,
\end{align*}
where $\ma A_t \equiv \ma A(\ve r(t), t)$ for brevity.
The perturbation expansion is computed  to any order in $\ku$ by recursively inserting the entire right hand side of \Eqnref{n_expansion} into each occurence of $\ve n_t$.
Iterating once we find
\begin{align}
\ve n_{t'}&=\ve n_0\!+\!\ku\!\int_0^{t'}\!\!\!\!{\rm d}t\,[\ma O_{t}\ve n_{0}\! +\!\Lambda(\ma S_{t}\ve n_{0}\!-\!(\ve n_{0}\transpose\ma S_{t}\ve n_{0})\ve n_{0})]\, + \mathcal O(\ku^2)
\eqnlab{n_expansion}
\end{align}

In principle, we could continue, however, for the present purpose, this first order expansion is enough.
We insert the expansion \eqnref{n_expansion} into \Eqnref{ndotsquared} and find to third order in $\ku$
\begin{align*}
	\langle \dot n^2\rangle &= \ku^2\left\langle-\ve n\transpose \ma O \ma O \ve n + \Lambda^2\left(\ve n\transpose\ma S\ma S\ve n - (\ve n\transpose\ma S\ve n)^2\right)\right\rangle\\
	&= \ku^2\left\langle-\ve n_0\transpose \ma O \ma O \ve n_0 + \Lambda^2\left(\ve n_0\transpose\ma S\ma S\ve n_0 - (\ve n_0\transpose\ma S\ve n_0)^2\right)\right\rangle \\
	&\,\,\,+ 2\ku^3 \int_0^{t'}\!\!\!\!{\rm d}t \bigg[
	 - \left\langle\ve n_0\transpose \ma O \ma O [\ma O_{t}\ve n_{0}\! +\!\Lambda(\ma S_{t}\ve n_{0}\!-\!(\ve n_{0}\transpose\ma S_{t}\ve n_{0})\ve n_{0})] \right\rangle\\
	&\qquad+\Lambda^2\left\langle\ve n_0\transpose\ma S\ma S[\ma O_{t}\ve n_{0}\! +\!\Lambda(\ma S_{t}\ve n_{0}\!-\!(\ve n_{0}\transpose\ma S_{t}\ve n_{0})\ve n_{0})] \right\rangle\\
	&\qquad - \Lambda^2\left\langle(\ve n_0\transpose\ma S[\ma O_{t}\ve n_{0}\! +\!\Lambda(\ma S_{t}\ve n_{0}\!-\!(\ve n_{0}\transpose\ma S_{t}\ve n_{0})\ve n_{0})])^2\right\rangle\bigg]
\end{align*}











\begin{align}
\eqnlab{expansion_general}
\langle{\dot n^2}\rangle&={\rm Ku}^2 \big(-5\tr\,\langle{\ma O}^2\rangle+ 3\Lambda^2\tr\,\langle{\ma S}^2\rangle\big)/15 \\&
\quad+\frac{2}{5}\ku^3\Lambda\int_0^\infty\!\!\!\!\rd t
\big[ \!-\!\tr\,\langle\ma O_0^2\ma S_{-t}\rangle
\!+\!2\Lambda\tr\,\langle\ma S_0\ma O_0\ma S_{-t}\rangle
\!+\!\frac{3}{7}\Lambda^2\tr\,\langle\ma S_0^2\ma S_{-t}\rangle
\big]\,.\nn
\end{align}


\section{Turbulent flow data}

We do not ourselves have the resources to produce a numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. But researchers at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) have published the data from a large direct numerical simulation\footnote{\url{http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/}} \cite{li2008}. The JHU database contains the velocity and pressure fields of homogenous, isotropic and incompressible turbulence. The domain is a periodic box, and the data covers circa 45 Kolmogorov times, corresponding to the turn-around time of the largest eddy. 

The JHU database stores the data (\unit[27]{TB}) in a computing cluster, which we can access with a remote programming interface. We may query for the velocity and pressure fields, as well as their derivatives, at any time and position in the dataset. The JHU database provides both spatial and temporal interpolation, so to us the dataset is for practical purposes continuous.

We initialise a particle at a random position $\ve r$, with a random orientation $\ve n$, and query for the velocity field $\ve u(\ve r(t), t)$ and gradient field $\ma A(\ve r(t), t)$. Then we update the position and orientation by
\begin{align*}
	\dot {\ve r} &= \ve u(\ve r(t), t), \\
	\dot {\ve n} &= \ma O \ve n + \Lambda\left(\ma S \ve n - \ve n \ve n\transpose \ma S \ve n\right).
\end{align*}
The procedure is repeated for the entire duration of the data set. We can then compute the required correlation functions, and other observables such as particle alignment with vorticity $\langle|\ve \Omega \cdot \ve n|\rangle$.
