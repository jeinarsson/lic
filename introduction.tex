\chapter{Outline}

This thesis concerns the orientational dynamics of small, rigid particles suspended in fluid flows. That is a mouthful of technical terms, all of which are meaningless without further explanation. The first and foremost purpose of this thesis summary to give this explanation. By doing so I intend to put my work thus far in context. In addition this summary serves two more purposes. The second purpose is to introduce the research papers into the established context, and convey their main points without getting bogged down by the technical details. The third and final purpose is to allow me to elaborate on material which is not published and peer-reviewed, but still of interest \todo{reformulate last point}
