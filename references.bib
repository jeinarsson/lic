The methods for simulating the scattering of light by various non-spherical shapes have rapidly evolved over the last two decades. However, the majority of aerosol remote-sensing retrievals still rely on the Mie theory because retrievals accounting for particle non-sphericity are not as well defined methodologically and are demanding computationally. We propose a method for the retrieval of the optical properties of non-spherical aerosol based on the model of a shape mixture of randomly oriented polydisperse spheroids. This method is applied to angular and spectral radiation measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network ({AERONET)} in locations influenced by desert dust. Comparisons with Mie-based retrievals show a significant improvement in dust-particle phase functions, size distributions, and refractive indices.},

We find several new periodic and steady rotation modes for a prolate spheroid for Reynolds numbers () exceeding 305. The simulations cover the regime up to . The rotational behaviour of the spheroid appears to be not only sensitive to the Reynolds number but also to its initial orientation. We discuss the effects of initial orientation in detail. For we find that the prolate spheroid reaches a periodic mode characterized by precession and nutation around an inclined axis which is located close to the middle plane where the velocity is zero. For , the prolate spheroid precesses around the vorticity direction with a nutation. For close to the critical , a period-doubling phenomenon is observed. We also identify a motionless mode at higher Reynolds numbers () for the prolate spheroid. For the oblate spheroid the dynamic equilibrium modes found are log rolling, inclined rolling and different steady states for increasing from 0 to 520. The initial-orientation effects are studied by simulations of 57 evenly distributed initial orientations for each investigated. Only one mode is found for the prolate spheroid for and . In other regimes, more than one mode is possible and the final mode is sensitive to the initial orientation. However, the oblate spheroid dynamics are insensitive to its initial orientation.},

Direct numerical simulations ({DNS)} of turbulent flows demonstrate that rod-like particles are more strongly aligned with the vorticity vector than with the principal strain axis. To elucidate this property, we compare the evolution obtained in a turbulent flow with a simpler model, where the velocity gradient of the flow is replaced by a fluctuating random matrix, whose temporal correlations reproduce the properties observed in {DNS.} In contrast with the {DNS} results, this model exhibits a strong alignment of the rods with the direction of the fastest stretching of the symmetric part of the random matrix. We argue that the correlation between the rod axis and the vorticity vector arises from similarities between the equations of motion governing these quantities.},

	abstract = {The magnetite fabrics measured by anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility ({AMS)} and by shape preferred orientation ({SPO)} optical methods are classically used as flow kinematics indicators in lava flows. The development of magnetite fabrics during simple shear strains γ ≤ 20 was performed using a suspension of 1\% volume fraction of multidomain magnetite randomly contained in a mixture of silicone and wax. We measured {AMS} fabric and {SPO} ellipsoids by calculating a quadratic shape tensor from oriented thin-sections. For γ \&lt; 8, fabrics obey to the theoretical model of rotation of Jeffery (1922). Fabrics are usable to determine the flow kinematics, including the amount of applied finite strain. For γ \&gt; 8, fabric elements, foliation and lineation, are stabilised closely parallel to the flow plane and the shear direction, respectively. Two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations using measured aspect ratios of magnetite point out that the large scattering of aspect ratios and the initial orientation distribution of particles are together responsible for a wide-ranging loss of periodicity. The stable {AMS} and {SPO} fabrics observed at large strains in experiments are the result of these primary fabric properties combined to collisions between particles and, possibly, their complex three-dimensional shapes. In addition, the constant angular relationship observed at large strains between fabrics and flow components is related to the transient collisions. Consequently, the determination of the lava flow kinematics by using fabric properties measured either by {AMS} or by {SPO} analyses should be indubitably associated to a detailed study of the three-dimensional shape of the solid carriers. Regularly shaped populations of low elongated particles will be capable to produce cyclic to oscillating fabrics, while the fabric of elongated particles will be more sensitive to the shape parameters and collisions, ultimately favouring stable fabrics at large strains.},

	abstract = {Studies of direct numerical simulations of incompressible, homogeneous, and inhomogeneous turbulence indicate that, in regions of high kinetic energy dissipation rate, the geometry of the local velocity gradient field has a universal character. The velocity gradient tensor satisfies the nonlinear evolution equation ({dAij/dt)+AikAkj−1/3} ({AmnAnm)δij=Hij} where Aij=∂ui/∂xj and the tensor Hij contains terms involving the action of cross derivatives of the pressure field and viscous diffusion of Aij. The restricted Euler equation corresponding to Hij=0 can be solved in closed form [Cantwell, Phys. Fluids A 4, 782 (1992)] and the solution has the property that, for any initial condition, Aij(t) evolves to an asymptotic state of the form Aij({t)≂Kij[R(t)]1/3} where R(t) is a function which becomes singular in a finite time and Kij is a constant matrix. A number of the universal features of fine‐scale motions observed in direct numerical simulations are reproduced by {Kij.In} the simulation studies the first invariant of Aij is zero by incompressibility. The second and third invariants, Q and R, are determined at every grid point in the flow and the entire data set is cross‐plotted to search for significant features in the space of tensor invariants. Such features can then be associated with corresponding local flow structures in physical space. When a variety of incompressible simulations are studied, scatter plots of Q vs R reveal that a fairly significant fraction of the data lies in the lower right quadrant. This is consistent with behavior predicted by the restricted Euler solution. However, the bulk of the data lies more or less uniformly distributed in a slightly elliptical region about the origin. In a direct numerical simulation of a plane, time‐developing, mixing layer a small fraction of the data collects along a very pronounced, nearly straight, ridgeline extending into the upper left quadrant. This data can be traced to regions with local vorticity much larger than the local strain lying within streamwise rib vortices which connect adjacent spanwise rollers in the mixing layer simulation. Neither the predominant tendency for Q and R to lie near the origin nor the possibility for Q and R to lie far from the origin in the upper left quadrant are predicted by the restricted Euler solution. The purpose of this paper is to show that, by relaxing the assumption Hij=0 while retaining a model of {dAij/dt} motivated by the asymptotic form of the restricted Euler solution, one can begin to account for these features of the ({Q,R)} scatter plots. The results suggest that the velocity gradient tensor in three‐dimensional flow tends to evolve toward an attractor in the space of tensor invariants. A significant feature of the model is that, although Hij≠0, singular behavior of Aij(t) can still occur along specific paths in the ({Q,R)} plane corresponding to zero values of the discriminant of Hij.},

A satisfactory theoretical interpretation of the {non‐Newtonian} viscosity of solutions of ellipsoidal particles has been given by Kuhn and Kuhn, and also by Saito, who made use of Peterlin's distribution function for the orientation of particle axes in the streaming liquid and calculated the energy dissipation due to both the hydrodynamic orientation and the Brownian motion. Also, a theory for the {non‐Newtonian} viscosity of solutions of rod‐like particles has been developed by Kirkwood. These theories involve extensive computations which have been carried out here with the aid of a computing machine by expressing Saito's results in terms of Legendre coefficients previously evaluated in the related problem of double refraction of flow. As a result, data are available for the dependence of the viscosity factor v on axial ratio and on the parameter α, where α = G/Θ, G being the velocity gradient in sec—1 and Θ being the rotary diffusion constant in sec—1. With these data it will be possible to determine the rotary diffusion constants of ellipsoidal particles from the {non‐Newtonian} viscosity of their solutions, and also to correct viscosity measurements to zero velocity gradient in order to obtain the intrinsic viscosity. Data are also included for the evaluation of Θ from the dependence of v at α = 0 on the frequency of periodic shear waves.},

	abstract = {A review is presented of the low-shear rheology of isotropic rod dispersions. Various theoretical descriptions are compared, and trends in experiments on a variety of rods and rodlike polymers are identified and discussed. For dilute dispersions, the intrinsic viscosity [η] is only a function of the rod dimensions and hardly depends on specific system characteristics like chain flexibility, weak colloidal attractions, Brownian motion and surface roughness. For a large range of aspect ratios (20\&lt;r\&lt;1000), the asymptotic result of Onsager: [η]≈(4r215 ln r) predicts intrinsic viscosities surprisingly well. At higher particle concentrations though, the shear viscosity is dominated by specific interactions between the rods. For Brownian rods, the semi-empirical {“Krieger-Dougherty”} equation predicts the viscosity fairly well. The dramatic effect of deviations from hard-rod interactions can be modelled by adapting the isotropic volume fraction at which the low-shear viscosity diverges. The viscosity data of non-Brownian fibres are better described by the {“Quemada”} or {“Maron-Pierce”} equation. Experiments on well-defined (inorganic) model colloids are needed to quantify the concentration-dependence of the low-shear viscosity for rod dispersions. Theoretical calculations are still incapable of predicting this dependence.},

The theory of dilute suspensions with elongated particles is briefly summarized and explicit formulae for the dependence of the intrinsic viscosity on the particle shape (aspect ratio) are given in a form that should be useful for practical purposes. Concentration regimes, the influence of Brownian motion and sedimentation kinetics are mentioned. The effective viscosity of suspensions of two polydisperse wollastonites with significantly different average aspect ratios (approximately 5 and 16, respectively) is measured in dependence of the solids volume fraction and fitted with power-law models (Krieger and {Maron–Pierce} relations). It is shown that the intrinsic viscosity determined is higher than theoretically predicted via the Brenner formula, while the critical volume fraction is lower than predicted by the empirical Kitano relation. Possible reasons for these discrepancies, common to most real polydisperse systems, are discussed.},

The large extinction coefficient for the hematite system at the wavelength used (? = 392 nm) enables rheo-optic experiments on truly dilute suspensions to be undertaken. The elimination of any particle?particle interactions ensures that the measurements obtained can be directly related to the induced physical changes of the isolated particles. Optical absorbance spectra have been measured over a range of shear rates and angle of light polarization relative to the shear direction. The measured absorbance changes can be directly attributed to the shear-induced anisotropy in the suspension due to particle alignment. The results indicate that the hematite particles align with the direction of shear. The transition in the particle orientation is observed from a random Brownian-dominated system at Pe {\textless} 3, to a more ordered system under shear at Pe {\textgreater} 60. Plateau values in the measured spectra are observed at high Peclet numbers, indicating that a limiting degree of particle orientation occurs. Convergence of the observed extinction coefficients to zero at a polarization angle of ?55° is seen at high Peclet numbers.},

The rods are 20 to 30 microns long and their diameters are of the order of 1 micron. Images of the centre-of-mass motion and the orientational dynamics of the rods are recorded using a microscope equipped with a {CCD} camera. A motorised microscope stage is used to track individual rods as they move along the channel. Automated image analysis determines the position and orientation of a tracked rods in each video frame. We find different behaviours, depending on the particle shape, its initial position, and orientation. First, we observe periodic as well as aperiodic tumbling. Second, the data show that different tumbling trajectories exhibit different sensitivities to external perturbations. These observations can be explained by slight asymmetries of the rods. Third we observe that after some time, initially periodic trajectories lose their phase. We attribute this to drift of the centre of mass of the rod from one to another stream line of the channel flow.},

The {\{Q;} R\} space is a planar projection of the new three-dimensional representation. In the {\{Q;} −sss; ωωs\} space the Lagrangian evolution of the velocity gradient tensor Aij is studied via conditional mean trajectories ({CMTs)} as introduced by Martín et al. (Phys. Fluids, vol. 10, 1998, p. 2012). From an analysis of a numerical data set for isotropic turbulence of Reλ {\textasciitilde} 434, taken from the Johns Hopkins University ({JHU)} turbulence database, we observe a pronounced cyclic evolution that is almost perpendicular to the {Q–R} plane. The relatively weak cyclic evolution in the {Q–R} space is thus only a projection of a much stronger cycle in the {\{Q;} −sss; ωωs\} space. Further, we find that the restricted Euler ({RE)} dynamics are primarily counteracted by the deviatoric non-local part of the pressure Hessian and not by the viscous term. The contribution of the Laplacian of Aij, on the other hand, seems the main responsible for intermittently alternating between low and high intensity Aij states.},

Although it has long been reasoned that the dynamical interactions between polymers and turbulence are responsible for {DR}, it was not until recently that progress had been made to begin to elucidate these interactions in detail. These advancements come largely from numerical simulations of viscoelastic turbulent flows and detailed turbulence measurements in flows of dilute polymer solutions using laser-based optical techniques.

The consistency K of suspensions of particles of arbitrary aspect ratio can be accurately predicted by the model of Maron \& Pierce (Maron \& Pierce 1956 J. Colloid Sci. 11, 80–95 (doi:10.1016/0095-8522(56)90023-X)) with the maximum packing fraction ϕm as the only fitted parameter. We derive empirical relationships for ϕm and n as a function of average particle aspect ratio rp and for τ0 as a function of ϕm and a fitting parameter τ*. These relationships can be used to predict the rheology of suspensions of prolate particles from measured ϕ and rp. By recasting our data in terms of the Einstein coefficient, we relate our rheological observations to the underlying particle motions via Jeffery’s (Jeffery 1922 Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 102, 161–179 (doi:10.1098/rspa.1922.0078)) theory. We extend Jeffery’s work to calculate, numerically, the Einstein coefficient for a suspension of many, initially randomly oriented particles. This provides a physical, microstructural explanation of our observations, including transient oscillations seen during run start-up and changes of rheological regime as ϕ increases.},
